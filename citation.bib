  abstract  = {Anyone who has studied "abstract algebra" and linear algebra as an undergraduate can understand this book. This edition has been completely revised and reorganized, without however losing any of the clarity of presentation that was the hallmark of the previous editions. The first six chapters provide ample material for a first course: beginning with the basic properties of groups and homomorphisms, topics covered include Lagrange's theorem, the Noether isomorphism theorems, symmetric groups, G-sets, the Sylow theorems, finite Abelian groups, the Krull-Schmidt theorem, solvable and nilpotent groups, and the Jordan-Holder theorem. The middle portion of the book uses the Jordan-Holder theorem to organize the discussion of extensions (automorphism groups, semidirect products, the Schur-Zassenhaus lemma, Schur multipliers) and simple groups (simplicity of projective unimodular groups and, after a return to G-sets, a construction of the sporadic Mathieu groups).},

It successfully addresses the basic concepts of algebra. For the revised third edition, the author has added exercises and made numerous corrections to the text. Comments on Serge Lang's Algebra: Lang's Algebra changed the way graduate algebra is taught, retaining classical topics but introducing language and ways of thinking from category theory and homological algebra. It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books. April 1999 Notices of the AMS, announcing that the author was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition for his many mathematics books. The author has an impressive knack for presenting the important and interesting ideas of algebra in just the "right" way, and he never gets bogged down in the dry formalism which pervades some parts of algebra.

  abstract  = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},
