Notes for Algebra at the Undergraduate Level

This document was written in the summer of 2023
and continuously updated currently
for the purpose of helping myself review the material
in various classes of algebra.
It is based on Prof. Vatsal's MATH 322 & 323
and Prof. Silberman's MATH 412 in-class notes.
